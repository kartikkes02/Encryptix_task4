                    Mahendra Singh Dhoni (commonly known as M. S. Dhoni) is an retired <br> Indian cricketer who captained the
                    Indian team in limited-overs formats from <br> 2007 to 2016 and in Test cricket from 2008 to 2014. 
                    An attacking right-handed <br> middle-order batsman and wicket-keeper, he is widely regarded as one of 
                    the greatest finishers in limited-overs cricket.<br> He made his One Day International (ODI) 
                    debut in December 2004 <br> against Bangladesh, and played his first Test a year later against 
                    Sri Lanka.
